# Open Road Profiler (ORP)

The **Open Road Profiler (ORP)** is an advanced, open-source system engineered to map the degradation of theoretical road designs developed by Caltrans. This precision gantry platform leverages a robust integration of **computer vision**, **LiDAR sensing**, and **optical measurement** technologies, including a Garmin LiDAR-Lite v3HP, a 64MP high-resolution camera, and a Class II precision laser, to capture sub-millimeter road surface details crucial for high-fidelity data.

## About

Purpose-built to support the **Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS)**, the ORP delivers end-to-end **systems engineering** for tracking pavement wear under simulated traffic conditions. Through repeated **V&V (Verification & Validation)** cycles via external encoder sensors, the ORP system collects accurate degradation metrics, creating highly detailed point clouds and digital maps of road surfaces. These insights are pivotal in optimizing roads for the state of California.

# Project Leadership

Led by **Asad Melibaev**, the project emphasizes a modular, scalable design, ensuring smooth integration with existing systems and adaptability to future sensing technologies. With support from a dedicated team of R&D engineers, PhD researchers, and machinists, the ORPâ€™s goal is to enable precise, actionable data analysis to inform road composition improvements and advance Caltrans' pavement research efforts.
