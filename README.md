### The initial design stage of the profilometer was quite difficult, I came up with multiple hand sketches and some digital sketches, However after consulting with two engineers and a specialzed machinist, I realized that the design was not viable. The primary reason being that I did not take into account some of the constraints on the testing tracks:

## Here are some of the digital CAD models that I created after the initial few sketches and consultations:

### After some further discussion with the machnist (Andy) and Geotechnical Engineer (Stephan) we have decided that it would be a good 
### decision to contact the company that builds premade linear guide solutions, but to also try to design our own solution.

# Comparison of Custom solution vs Ready-made solution

1. Custom Solution (2500mm stroke distance):
- HGH15 Linear rail: $442
- Nema 23 motor: $38
- 40mm single T-slot extrusion: $111
- motor and idler pulleys: $20
- labor cost excluding Andy's help for custom machined parts: $720

- Total: $1331

2. Ready Solution (2500mm stroke distance):
- [LC40B](https://www.zaber.com/products/linear-stages/LC40B-KM01/specs?part=LC40B2550-KM01)

- Total: $3,193
